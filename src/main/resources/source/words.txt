There are so many concepts that you should know before getting your hands dirty.
Itâ€™s very difficult to go through each and every concept here, instead, we go through important
concepts that are necessary to implement the basic example.
Pipeline
A pipeline is nothing but a series of simple tasks executed to get the desired output.
These tasks can be executed sequentially or in parallel based on the need.
You can design the pipeline in a number of ways.
Let's look at the basic pipeline we have one file in the source bucket,
we read it and transform it into a collection called Pcollection (discuss later in detail),
and then transform and load into a destination bucket.
